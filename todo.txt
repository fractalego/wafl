### TODO
!* add deixis on the interface (at least for output!! so when the system ask for questions they have "you")
!* make it so one can define variables as strings: list = {list}, apples; statement = {user} is {feeling}
!* Implement FORGET (the whole Fact should disappear from Knowledge)


* Better QA for yes/no question (maybe add SNLI to qa?)
* Add math expressions to fact-checker (some, any, every)

* Implement Server with HTML page (docker-compose up)
* Refactor code and clean up
* Investigate interplay btw substitutions and already_matched
  - Maybe one can avoid having same answer for btw same question and same depth (and same rule)
