### TODO

* working memory only within the same level of rules with same activation
  GET WORKING MEMORY FOR FACTS WORKING WITH SHOPPING LIST!!

* write aux function that create standard formatting (for punctuation at end of string and lowercase)

* New voice! It's ridiculous to have to have a memory leak from picotts
    - Use fairseq voices

!* Create conversation tests in userspace
!* Working memory should really be working knowledge
!* refactor BackwardInference

!* make it so if the user does not know the answer, one can continue inference?
   - Or should you try to do the inference first??
!* Implement a standard sign for code. Should it be '''> ?
!* Implement FORGET (the whole Fact should disappear from Knowledge)

* add hotwords to config.json
* Working memory is unnecessarily complicated. It can just contain the story and some method to automatically fill it.
!* Why did it say "no" on "can you please add bananas to the shopping list?"
* Better QA for yes/no question (maybe add SNLI to qa?)
* Add math expressions to fact-checker (some, any, every)
* USER REQUEST: Multiple items to the shopping list in one go: apples AND bananas AND vegetables
* create tests for voice
* Parser should allow for empty lines within rules
* Implement Server with HTML page (docker-compose up)
* Refactor code and clean up
* Investigate interplay btw substitutions and already_matched
  - Maybe one can avoid having same answer for btw same question and same depth (and same rule)
