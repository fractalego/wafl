### TODO

* Why is 'NNO' preferred over "NO" in choose_best_output()?


* Why does remove X from the shopping list trigger so many other clauses?
  - Make it so if the system remembers clauses that failed (and don't run them again)
  - If a query has high entropy you need to control it somehow.
     - remove activates add as of now!
     - maybe you can cluster the rules and only choose the first cluster

* Add working memory for python-space
    - Maybe exclude WM answer if it is the same as the prior answer

* Python hooks need to be in a class, like with Tests

* Change the speaker voice

* Create unit tests for conversation activation/deactivation

* WHY DOES "E t" activate rules?
user> E t
RECURSION: 0 Query(text="The user says: 'E t.'", is_question=False, variable='name')

* The answer to the question can be found in the conversation from the bot.
  The bot can speak to itself and then answer the user

* If a function calls another one within functions.py then there is an argument missing! inference is not there in the code

*yes/no questions should *never* trigger an interruption.
 It's not just yes/no answers, the deal is with the question!



* Select by levenstein distance before text_retriever (lev_retriever?)
* train bart for qa/facts
* train your own retriever

* Why is everything interpreted as "hello" or "hi"? You need a better retriever
  - Change retriever with the one you liked


* allow {variable} to be interpreted as code/call for another task (at least add tests)
* allow some type of introspection

* finish config
 - add hotwords to config.json
* upload to github, with tests and logs
* validate the user code (is REMEMBR spelled correctly?)

* should yes/no filter be in retriever instead of knowledge?

* Create interfaces for google voice, other apis
* A goal oriented bot would scan all the rules to find how to obtain the goal.
  The user can be simulated using a generative model for dialogue.

* for yes/no or limited choice questions there should not be ambiguity. The machine should match the closest item and
  if there is no item close enough ask again.


* New voice! It's ridiculous to have to have a memory leak from picotts
    - Use fairseq voices

* why is Alberto not recognized as a name by the retriever? need a better retriever than MSMARCO distill
* Working memory should really be working knowledge
* refactor BackwardInference

!* make it so if the user does not know the answer, one can continue inference?
   - Or should you try to do the inference first??
!* Implement a standard sign for code. Should it be '''> ?
!* Implement FORGET (the whole Fact should disappear from Knowledge)


* Do not allow arbitrary input (at least for voice)
* Working memory is unnecessarily complicated. It can just contain the story and some method to automatically fill it.
!* Why did it say "no" on "can you please add bananas to the shopping list?"
* Better QA for yes/no question (maybe add SNLI to qa?)
* Add math expressions to fact-checker (some, any, every)
* USER REQUEST: Multiple items to the shopping list in one go: apples AND bananas AND vegetables
* create tests for voice
* Parser should allow for empty lines within rules
* Implement Server with HTML page (docker-compose up)
* Refactor code and clean up

* Investigate interplay btw substitutions and already_matched
  - Maybe one can avoid having same answer for btw same question and same depth (and same rule)
* Say "This is true" or "this is false" if a statement matches (My name is Alberto -> True)
* working memory only within the same level of rules with same activation
  GET WORKING MEMORY FOR FACTS WORKING WITH SHOPPING LIST!!
