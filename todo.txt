### TODO

* "O do" triggers good bye. WHY?!


* should yes/no filter be in retriever instead of knowledge?
* yes/no answers should never trigger an interruption in Knowledge.has_better_match()

* for yes/no or limited choice questions there should not be ambiguity. The machine should match the closest item and
  if there is no item close enough ask again.

* New voice! It's ridiculous to have to have a memory leak from picotts
    - Use fairseq voices

* why is Alberto not recognized as a name by the retriever? need a better retriever than MSMARCO distill
* Create conversation tests in userspace
* Working memory should really be working knowledge
* refactor BackwardInference

!* make it so if the user does not know the answer, one can continue inference?
   - Or should you try to do the inference first??
!* Implement a standard sign for code. Should it be '''> ?
!* Implement FORGET (the whole Fact should disappear from Knowledge)

* add hotwords to config.json
* Do not allow arbitrary input (at least for voice)
* Working memory is unnecessarily complicated. It can just contain the story and some method to automatically fill it.
!* Why did it say "no" on "can you please add bananas to the shopping list?"
* Better QA for yes/no question (maybe add SNLI to qa?)
* Add math expressions to fact-checker (some, any, every)
* USER REQUEST: Multiple items to the shopping list in one go: apples AND bananas AND vegetables
* create tests for voice
* Parser should allow for empty lines within rules
* Implement Server with HTML page (docker-compose up)
* Refactor code and clean up

* Investigate interplay btw substitutions and already_matched
  - Maybe one can avoid having same answer for btw same question and same depth (and same rule)
* Say "This is true" or "this is false" if a statement matches (My name is Alberto -> True)
* working memory only within the same level of rules with same activation
  GET WORKING MEMORY FOR FACTS WORKING WITH SHOPPING LIST!!
