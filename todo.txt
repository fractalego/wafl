### TODO
* Use entailment to make generated qa more accurate
    /- Upload qa system to huggingface and pip
    -**** Use conversation_qa -> refactor qa.py

* functions.py need a more clever way of handling hidden arguments
  - should all functions have a hidden arg?
  - make it possible to have more files

* use different voice model (this one from hf?  )

* speech to text
    - use your own beam decoder + n-gram to improve quality
    - use newer model?
    - filter out filler sounds

* Unify conversation/utils.py "the user says/asks" and the presupposition replace "to the bot" in entailer.py

* Detect who is talking to whom. Some rules can only be activated by the user speaking to the bot
    - Use get_sequence_probability_given_prompt()

* add in knowledge facts about "the user". You don't need to remember everything that is said

* Is there a need for a "Main Task" ? One that oversees everything?

* Python hooks need to be in a class, like with Tests

* rms threshold should be average of background noise
* add delete last item


* Change the speaker voice

* Create unit tests for conversation activation/deactivation

* The answer to the question can be found in the conversation from the bot.
  The bot can speak to itself and then answer the user

* train your own retriever using the conversations in dailydialogue? MAYBE NOT
* If the query is a question YOU NEED A QA RETRIEVER. take MULTI_QA instead of MSMARCO
  - also if the rule.effect is a question


* If a function calls another one within functions.py then there is an argument missing! inference is not there in the code

*yes/no questions should *never* trigger an interruption.
 It's not just yes/no answers, the deal is with the question!



* Select by levenstein distance before text_retriever (lev_retriever?)
* train bart for qa/facts
* train your own retriever

* Why is everything interpreted as "hello" or "hi"? You need a better retriever
  - Change retriever with the one you liked


* allow {variable} to be interpreted as code/call for another task (at least add tests)
* allow some type of introspection

* finish config
 - add hotwords to config.json
* upload to github, with tests and logs
* validate the user code (is REMEMBR spelled correctly?)

* should yes/no filter be in retriever instead of knowledge?

* Create interfaces for google voice, other apis
* A goal oriented bot would scan all the rules to find how to obtain the goal.
  The user can be simulated using a generative model for dialogue.

* for yes/no or limited choice questions there should not be ambiguity. The machine should match the closest item and
  if there is no item close enough ask again.


* New voice! It's ridiculous to have to have a memory leak from picotts
    - Use fairseq voices

* why is Alberto not recognized as a name by the retriever? need a better retriever than MSMARCO distill
* Working memory should really be working knowledge
* refactor BackwardInference

!* make it so if the user does not know the answer, one can continue inference?
   - Or should you try to do the inference first??
!* Implement a standard sign for code. Should it be '''> ?
!* Implement FORGET (the whole Fact should disappear from Knowledge)


* Do not allow arbitrary input (at least for voice)
* Working memory is unnecessarily complicated. It can just contain the story and some method to automatically fill it.
!* Why did it say "no" on "can you please add bananas to the shopping list?"
* Better QA for yes/no question (maybe add SNLI to qa?)
* Add math expressions to fact-checker (some, any, every)
* USER REQUEST: Multiple items to the shopping list in one go: apples AND bananas AND vegetables
* create tests for voice
* Parser should allow for empty lines within rules
* Implement Server with HTML page (docker-compose up)
* Refactor code and clean up

* Investigate interplay btw substitutions and already_matched
  - Maybe one can avoid having same answer for btw same question and same depth (and same rule)
* Say "This is true" or "this is false" if a statement matches (My name is Alberto -> True)
* working memory only within the same level of rules with same activation
  GET WORKING MEMORY FOR FACTS WORKING WITH SHOPPING LIST!!

/* Add working memory for python-space
    - Maybe exclude WM answer if it is the same as the prior answer
