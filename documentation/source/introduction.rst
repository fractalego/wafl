Introduction
============

WAFL is a framework for personal agents.
It integrates Large language models, speech recognition and text to speech.

This framework combines Large Language Models and rules to create a predictable behavior.
Specifically, instead of organising the work of an LLM into a chain of thoughts,
WAFL intends to organise its behavior into inference trees.

WAFL is a work in progress.
The current version requires the user to specify the rules to follow.
While it is ready to play with, it might not ready for production depending on your use-case.
