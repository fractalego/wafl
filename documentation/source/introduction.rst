Introduction
============

WAFL is a framework for personal agents. It integrates Large language models, speech recognition and text to speech.
This framework combines Large Language Models and rules to create a predictable behavior.
A set of rules is used to define the behavior of the agent, supporting function calling and a working memory.
The current version requires the user to specify the rules to follow.
