Introduction
============

WAFL is a framework for personal agents.
It integrates Large language models, speech recognition and text to speech.

This framework combines Large Language Models and rules to create a predictable behavior.
A set of rules is used to define the behavior of the agent, supporting function calling and a working memory.

WAFL is a work in progress.
The current version requires the user to specify the rules to follow.
While it is ready to play with, it might not ready for production depending on your use-case.
