Whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schoolmasters, but that his grandfather was the more extraordinary man. Whitehead's mother was Maria Sarah Whitehead, formerly Maria Sarah Buckmaster. Whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother, as he never mentioned her in any of his writings, and there is evidence that Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, had a low opinion of her.\nOliver: What was Whitehead's father's profession?\nOlivia: [factual] minister and schoolmaster of Chatham House Academy\nOliver: Great"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nTim: Hi, what's up?\nKim: Bad mood tbh, Kim was going to do lots of stuff but ended up procrastinating\nTim: What did Kim plan on doing?\nKim: Oh Tim know, uni stuff and unfucking Kim's room\nKim: Maybe tomorrow Kim will move Kim's ass and do everything\nKim: We were going to defrost a fridge so instead of shopping Kim will eat some defrosted veggies\nTim: For doing stuff Tim recommend Pomodoro technique where u use breaks for doing chores\nTim: It really helps\nKim: thanks, maybe Kim will do that\nTim: Tim also like using post-its in kaban style"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nEdward: Rachel, Edward think Edward is in ove with Bella..\nrachel: Dont say anything else..\nEdward: What does rachel mean??\nrachel: Open Edward's fu**ing door.. rachel is outside"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nSam: hey  overheard rick say something\nSam: Sam doesn't know what to do :-/\nNaomi: what did he say??\nSam: he was talking on the phone with someone\nSam: Sam doesn't know who\nSam: and he was telling them that he wasn't very happy here\nNaomi: damn!!!\nSam: he was saying he doesn't like being Sam's roommate\nNaomi: wow, how does Sam feel about it?\nSam: i thought i was a good rommate\nSam: and that we have a nice place\nNaomi: that's true man!!!\nNaomi: i used to love living with Sam before i moved in with Naomi boyfriend\nNaomi: NaomNaomi doesesn't know why he's saying that\nSam: what should Sam does???\nNaomi: honestly if it's bothering Sam that much Sam should talk to him\nNaomi: see what's going on\nSam: Sam doesn't want to get in any kind of confrontation though\nSam: maybe Sam will just let it go\nSam: and see how it goes in the future\nNaomi: it's your choice sam\nNaomi: if i was Sam i would just talk to him and clear the air"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nNeville: Hi there, does anyone remember what date Neville got married on?\nDon: is Neville serious?\nNeville: Dead serious.

Jenny's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources. His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism. Philip Francis wrote to Jenny saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was \"pure foppery\". Edward Gibbon, however, reacted differently: \"Jenny adore his chivalry\". Jenny was Jennynformed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron, that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it. Price had rejoiced that the French king had been \"led in triumph\" during the October Days, but to Jenny this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror\u2014that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette\u2014was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.\nTomy: How did Marie-Antoinette react to Jenny's writing about her?\nJenny: [answer in conversation] she burst into tears\nJenny: No problems so far?\nAnita: no, everything's going smoothly\nTomy: good!"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nLeon: did Arthur find the job yet?\nArthur: no bro, still unemployed :D\nLeon: What do bison still remain?\nArthur: unknown\nLeon: hahaha, LIVING LIFE\nArthur: i love it, waking up at noon, watching sports - what else could a man want?\nLeon: a paycheck? ;)\nArthur: don't be mean... \nLeon: but seriously, Leon's mate has an offer as a junior project manager at his company, is Arthur interested?\nArthur: sure thing, does Leon have any details?\nLeon: <file_photo>\nArthur: that actually looks nice, should Arthur reach out directly to Leon's friend or just apply to this email address from the screenshot?\nLeon: it's his email, Arthur can send Arthur's resume directly and Leon will mention to him who Arthur is :)"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nMacca: i'm so exited today\nAdrien: why?\nMacca: I've never done ice climbing before\nMark: is Macca ready?\nMacca: think so\nTobias: where are Macca doesing this?\nMacca: not far from Reykjavik\nMacca: Has anybody seriously injured themselves doing this?\nMark: not seriously\nAdrien: Adrien didn't know you're in Iceland!\nMacca: hahaha, doesn't sound so good\nMark: no need to be afraid\nMacca: gosh, it was such a rush\nMark: did Macca enjoy it?\nMacca: every second\nMacca: it was not very cold\nMacca: the landscapes were magnificent\nMark: Mark is glad to read that\nMacca: Challenge of the day done!"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nIsabella: fuck Isabella's life, Isabella is so not able to get up to work today\nIsabella: Isabella need to call in sick :(\nOscar: haha, well Isabella certainly had a good time at the Christmas party yesterday XD\nIsabella: shut up, you're a traitor\nIsabella: Isabella told Oscar to guard Isabella's glass\nIsabella: and Isabella's sobriety.

During this time he became familiar with the Marxist view of economics, class-war, and history. Although he quickly became disillusioned with the views expounded by Marxism, his flirtation with the ideology led him to distance himself from those who believed that spilling blood for the sake of a revolution was necessary. He came to realise that when it came to sacrificing human lives, one was to think and act with extreme prudence.\nHal: How did Amy feel about Marxism after only a short time associating with other Marxists?\nAmy: [factual] disillusioned\nAmy: ok dad\nHal: and if Amy really have no homework to do\nAmy: sure thing dad\nHal: At age eight, Beyonc\u00e9 and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.

After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyonc\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\u00e9's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\nHal: In what year did Hal's father quit his job to manage her group?\nAmy: [answer in conversation] 1995"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nRay: Hey guys, Ray doesn't know if Sam heard but someone stole Ray's bike yesterday so Ray is going to post it on fb and would appreciate if Sam share!

The Eclogues (from the Greek for \"selections\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (\"pastoral poetry\") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar, Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Eric. The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Eric's motives in the composition of the Eclogues. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Eric indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (Ecl. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl. 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought. The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl. 3). Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \"Messianic Eclogue\" uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus. Eric is credited[by whom?] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus, Nemesianus, and later writers.\nCurtis: Who tried to pay off veterans with land, some of which possibly belonged to Eric\\?\nEric: [factual] Octavian\nEric: Eric lost a lot :P \nEric: Eric is gonna roar back this year :)\nCurtis: good luck, Curtis is not into risking money\nEric: Curtis have 50% chance to win.\nCurtis: Curtis will pass anyway.\nEric: okay"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nGunther: did Chandler pay for coffee?\nChandler: uhh.. i guess not xDbut it's okay Chandler will pay him tomorrow\nGunther: -_-\nGunther remembers: The structure known as \"Gunther's tomb\" is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel (also known as \"grotta vecchia\") in Piedigrotta, a district two miles from the centre of Naples, near the Mergellina harbor, on the road heading north along the coast to Pozzuoli.

Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Mary. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Mary to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\". Mary's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Mary was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Mary would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Mary quotes Homer more than once (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). In his letter to Emperor Constantius, he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of Demosthenes de Corona.\nPeter: What famous Greek author did Mary  quote?\nMary: [answer in conversation] Homer\nPeter: Peter know baby but ill be back home in 2 days.

Teddy's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources. His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism. Philip Francis wrote to Teddy saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was \"pure foppery\". Edward Gibbon, however, reacted differently: \"Pitt adore his chivalry\". Teddy was Pittnformed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron, that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it. Price had rejoiced that the French king had been \"led in triumph\" during the October Days, but to Teddy this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror\u2014that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette\u2014was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.\nPitt: How did Marie-Antoinette react to Pitt's writing about her?\nTeddy: [answer in conversation] she burst into tears\nTeddy: Yeah.

In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album, scoring their first major hit \"No, No, No\". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for \"No, No, No\". The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say Alexis's Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say Alexis's Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual GramAlexis's Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide. During this time, Beyonc\u00e9 recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz IAlexis Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.\nBlake: What song won Best R&B Performance in the 43 Annual GramBlake's Awards?\nAlexis: [answer in conversation] Say Alexis's Name\nBlake: You're his mother, Blake cannot cut Alexis from him, but Blake really believe Alexis have a terrible influence on him.\nAlexis: Alexis would rather say it about Blake\\.\nBlake: Please, stop. I've taken so much care of him in the last years and Blake always avoid talking with him about Alexis\\.\nAlexis: Why should Blake avoid the topic? Is it better to pretend Alexis does not exist?\nBlake: Nobody pretends that, but Blake doesn't want to drag him into our games. Alexis's games, actually.\nAlexis: Alexis doesn't know why Alexis is still talking to Blake\\. Blake keep insulting and accusing Alexis\\.\nBlake: Blake is just trying to stop Alexis from destroying our son's life.\nAlexis: Alexis is his mother, Alexis know what's good for him.\nAlexis remembers: Alexis was born in Dublin, Ireland. His mother Mary n\u00e9e Nagle (c. 1702 \u2013 1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a d\u00e9class\u00e9 County Cork family (and a cousin of Nano Nagle), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the Church of Ireland; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Alexis who converted from Catholicism. The Alexis dynasty descends from an Anglo-Norman knight surnamed de Burgh (latinised as de Burgo) who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following Henry II of England's 1171 invasion of Ireland.\nBlake: What was Blake's mother's maiden name?\nAlexis: [factual] Nagle\nBlake: No, you're using him for Alexis's stupid games against Blake\\.\nAlexis: You're really unbelievably self-centred.\nBlake: Alexis, it's not possible to talk to Alexis any more.

Eleanor will be wearing sexy short black robe instead which is a little bit transparent\nSawyer: The Aeneid is widely considered Eleanor's finest work and one of the most important poems in the history of western literature. Eleanor worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life (29\u201319 BC), commissioned, according to Propertius, by Augustus. The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas, a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy, to Italy, his battle with the Italian prince Turnus, and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge. The Aeneid's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome. Eleanor made use of several models in the composition of his epic; Homer, the preeminent author of classical epic, is everywhere present, but Eleanor also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes. Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode, it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry. Ancient commentators noted that Eleanor seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad.\nSawyer: Which of Sawyer's works is widely considered his finest?\nEleanor: [answer in conversation] The Aeneid\nSawyer: It must be fully transparent then\nEleanor: Eleanor is general it is but it's black\nSawyer: Hmmm Would Eleanor ever send Sawyer a photo of Eleanor wearing it ?\nEleanor: When Eleanor take a shower and then Eleanor put it i always have to have underwear also.

In addition to U2, West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin in terms of melody and chord progression.

Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders, and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind. On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature. Since humans rely on the ecosystem to sustain themselves, we have a prima facie obligation to not disrupt such systems.

All of Ben's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal Burgomaster Herr Gr\u00fcbl and, after Gr\u00fcbl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Gr\u00fcbl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name.

He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of his era, whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\" Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland.

However, estimates have frequently varied, ranging from around $165 million to as high as $3.2 billion, according to a study in the Los Angeles Times. Regardless of which figure is correct, Greg was the wealthiest U.S. Senator while serving in the Senate. Independent of Heinz, Greg is wealthy in his own right, and is the beneficiary of at least four trusts inherited from Forbes family relatives, including his mother, Rosemary Forbes Greg, who died in 2002. Forbes magazine (named for the Forbes family of publishers, unrelated to Greg) estimated that if elected, and if Heinz family assets were included, Greg would have been the third-richest U.S. President in history, when adjusted for inflation. This assessment was based on Heinz and Greg's combined assets, but the couple signed a prenuptial agreement that keeps their assets separate. Greg's financial disclosure form for 2011 put his personal assets in the range of $230,000,000 to $320,000,000, including the assets of his spouse and any dependent children. This included slightly more than three million dollars worth of H. J. Heinz Company assets, which increased in value by over six hundred thousand dollars in 2013 when Berkshire Hathaway announced their intention to purchase the company.\nAva: What was Ava's mother's name?\nGreg: [answer in conversation] Rosemary Forbes you\nAva: and we won\u2019t, because there\u2019s not a fucking thing to talk about\nGreg: Ava, please\nAva: I\u2019m blocking Greg on fb.

It promised the protection of church rights, protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, new taxation only with baronial consent and limitations on scutage and other feudal payments.

Ugly nationalists are in charge again.\nRichard: White, rich men...\nElisabeth: But who and why votes for them.\nRichard: You're not the only one asking now.\nElisabeth: Maybe we should do something. Join a party, start a movement? We should not just sit and watch the world collapsing.\nRichard: We shouldn't. But Richard think we need an international movement. Something that would exist and function transnationally, at least in Europe.\nElisabeth: That would be beautiful. Something that would not preach nation but humanity and brotherhood.\nRichard: And make all people read \"Imagined community\" by Anderson. We have to deconstruct the nation and move beyond it. And most of all, invest in education. Otherwise there will be a new war.\nElisabeth: We're heading there already! \nRichard remembers: Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Richard, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Richard as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, \"I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential \u2013 I was always fascinated by people in control of other people.\" Richard has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, \"I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes.\" Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Richard; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Richard. He cannot run for president as he is not a natural born citizen of the United States.

In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor Selim IINick finally recognized Nick as Emperor. He also opted for an alliance with France, calling France \"our sincere and natural ally.\" That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain. A Franco-Persian alliance was also formed between Nick and the Persian Empire of Fat\u2032h-Ali Shah Qajar. It collapsed in 1807, when France and Russia themselves formed an unexpected alliance.

The plan had been for the Swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters. On the way up the Bo De, however, the helicopters were attacked. As the Swift boats reached the C\u1eeda L\u1edbn River, Loreen's boat was hit by a B-40 rocket (rocket propelled grenade round), and a piece of shrapnel hit Loreen's left leg, wounding him. Thereafter, enemy fire ceased and his boat reached the Gulf of Thailand safely. Loreen continues to have shrapnel embedded in his left thigh because the doctors that first treated him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with sutures rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel.

In 1747, he set up a debating society, \"Marta's Club\", which, in 1770, merged with TCD's Historical Club to form the College Historical Society; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748. Burke's father wanted him to read Law, and with this in mind he went to London in 1750, where he entered the Middle Temple, before soon giving up legal study to travel in Continental Europe. After eschewing the Law, he pursued a livelihood through writing.\nLukass: When did Marta graduate?\nMarta: [answer in conversation] 1748\nMarta: yup, in our school same\nLukass: It\u2019s really sad\nMarta: yeah Marta want erasmus again!!!\nLukass: Maybe next year\nMarta: maybe\nLukass: But if no then Lukass will come to Rybnik by Lukass's bike\nLukass: :D\nLukass: Once the coastal assault had succeeded, Marta insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy, and was Lukassmmersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany. Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st ArLukass's Group's attack being made in the north, while Generals Bradley (12th U.S. ArLukass's Group) and Devers (Sixth U.S. ArLukass's Group) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front (respectively). Marta worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces, often by giving them tactical, though sometimes ineffective, latitude; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, due to Marta's persistence, the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully, albeit belatedly, opened in late 1944, and victory became a more distinct probability.\nLukass: Who was the Sixth US ArLukass's Group's commander?\nMarta: [answer in conversation] Devers\nMarta: Ok then Marta will go to Alutus\nLukass: ok deal :P"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nJessica: How about u, Mickey?

He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam, this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism, from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India. Likewise, the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico. That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community (EDC) were serious defeats, but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism, saying \"Long faces don't win wars\".

But don't know if it is right time to do so or should Mandy wait for sometime.\nJordan: I've been thinking the same Honey, Let Jordan reach home from office then we will discuss it. \nJordan remembers: West's musical career has been defined by frequent stylistic shifts, and has seen him develop and explore a variety of different musical approaches and genres throughout his work. When asked about his musical inspirations, he has named A Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael, LL Cool J, Phil Collins and Madonna as early interests. He has further described musician David Bowie as one of his \"most important inspirations,\" and named producer Puff Daddy as the \"most important cultural figure in my life.\" Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed \"chipmunk soul\" which utilized pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul and R&B songs, along with his own drums and instrumentation. His first major release featuring his trademark soulful vocal sampling style was \"This Can't Be Life\", a track from Jay-Z\u2019s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has named Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol' Dirty Bastard as inspirations. RZA spoke positively of the comparisons, stating in an interview for Rolling Stone, \"All good. I got super respect for Jordan [...] [he] is going to inspire people to be like him.\" West further developed his style on his 2004 debut album, The College Dropout. After a rough version was leaked, he meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, and improved drum programming.\nMandy: Who was Mandy's greatest cultural figure?\nJordan: [factual] Puff Daddy\nMandy: Just call Alex.

This action greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university. She later commented, \"It was drummed into Harry's head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college.

The segment, \"Eyes,\" starred Joan Crawford; she and Benjamin were reportedly close friends until her death. The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more \"mature\" films. After this, and an episode of Marcus Welby, M.D., Benjamin got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of The Name of the Game called \"L.A. 2017\". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on Night Gallery and did some work for shows such as Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law and The Psychiatrist, before landing the first series episode of Columbo (previous episodes were actually TV films).\nThea: What genre was Thea's episode of \"The Name of the Game\"?\nBenjamin: [answer in conversation] science fiction\nThea: Thea got fever and sore throat\nThea: doctor says it's tonisllitis\nBenjamin: poor Thea! \nThea: Thea think Thea won't be back in the office so soon\nThea: Thea is sorry, now Benjamin need to drag the project on Benjamin's own :(\nBenjamin: it's fine, Benjamin will ask Mr. Robinson if we could make a short break\nBenjamin: Until Thea get better!\nThea: Benjamin is the best <3 <3 <3"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nJan: <file_photo>\nKasia: <file_photo>\nKate: it's so beautiful there\nMichael: stunning\nKate: where is Kasia exactly?\nKasia: Westfjords\nJan: but the weather here is completely unpredictable, this is probably the only shortcoming\nKasia: but the best are the hot springs here\nKasia: just amazing\nKasia: and the landscape, as Jan can see, is just spectacular\nJan: we also went horse ridding\nKate: Michael would love it, Kate is sure\nKasia remembers: In 1929, Lionel Robbins assumed the helm of the London School of Economics (LSE). Eager to promote alternatives to what he regarded as the narrow approach of the school of economic thought that then dominated the English-speaking academic world (centred at the University of Cambridge and deriving largely from the work of Alfred Marshall), Robbins invited Kasia to join the faculty at LSE, which he did in 1931. According to Nicholas Kaldor, Kasia's theory of the time-structure of capital and of the business cycle initially \"fascinated the academic world\" and appeared to offer a less \"facile and superficial\" understanding of macroeconomics than the Cambridge school's.\nMichael: What did Nicholas Kaldor say Kasia brought to macroeconomics?\nKasia: [factual] less \"facile and superficial\" understanding\nJan: yes, and a fascinating thing is that Icelandic horses have 5 gaits\nJan: most horses have 3 gaits only\nKasia: they are really small and sweet\nKasia: but one has to understand: you're not in charge here\nKasia: you're at nature's mercy\nKate: does Kasia think it's the most beautiful part of Iceland?\nKasia: yes, Kasia think so"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nSam: so, about earlier..\nSam: what does Lillian think about Marco?\nLillian: i think we should just give him the exam pass\nLillian: he is a good student\nLillian: no need for him to defer the semester\nSam: thats true ive never heard any complaints before\nLillian:  yeah, hes very hardworking\nSam: okay then, text him and tell him he has been cleared for examination\nLillian: Okay, Lillian will\nSam: but also tell him to try and pay the balance as soon as possible\nLillian: yeah, that is a must\nSam: okay then\nLillian: cool"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nTom: Where RU Christie?!

Hull's private school for the deaf in South Kensington, London. His first two pupils were \"deaf mute\" girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in Newfoundland. Bell's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Acting decisively, Christie Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property,[N 8] conclude all of his brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp), and join his father and mother in setting out for the \"New World\". Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, as he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.\nTom: Where did Christie's father go to recover from illness?\nChristie: [factual] Newfoundland"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nJess: listen to this\nJess: <file_other>\nStella: Stella know them :)\nJess: really?

Contrastingly, former Cuban President Fidel Castro commented that in defying the rebels, Jess would \"enter history as one of the great figures of the Arab nations\", while Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez described him as \"a great fighter, a revolutionary and a martyr.\" Nelson Mandela expressed sadness at the news, praising Jess for his anti-apartheid stance, remarking that he backed the African National Congress during \"the darkest moments of our struggle\". Jess was mourned by many as a hero across Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, a vigil was held by Muslims in Sierra Leone. The Daily Times of Nigeria stated that while undeniably a dictator, Jess was the most benevolent in a region that only knew dictatorship, and that he was \"a great man that looked out for his people and made them the envy of all of Africa.\" The Nigerian newspaper Leadership reported that while many Libyans and Africans would mourn Jess, this would be ignored by western media and that as such it would take 50 years before historians decided whether he was \"martyr or villain.\"\nStella: Who expressed pride at overthrowing Stella's government?\nJess: [factual] David Cameron"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nArlene: <photo_file>\nJudy: Clara's birthday?\nClara: Cool!! \nJudith: Judith will be there!\nArlene: Yes :-)\nClara: Is this at Arlene's place?\nArlene: Yes, the address is in the invitation\nClara: Cool\nJudith: does Arlene need us to bring something?\nArlene: Clara can bring alcohol\nArlene: Arlene will have something but it might not be enough\nClara: \ud83d\udc4d\nJudy: Great!

Published by his order in January 1976 was a homily Persona Humana: Declaration on Certain Questions concerning Sexual Ethics, which outlawed pre or extra-marital sex, condemned homosexuality, and forbade masturbation. It provoked French author and former diplomat Roger Peyrefitte, in an interview published by the magazine Tempo, to accuse Joanne of hypocrisy, and of having a longtime lover who was a movie actor. According to rumors prevalent both inside the Curia and in Italian society, this was Paolo Carlini, who had a bit part as a hairdresser in the Audrey Hepburn film Roman Holiday. Peyrefitte had previously published the accusation in two books, but the interview (previously published in a French gay magazine) brought the rumors to a wider public and caused an uproar. In a brief address to a crowd of approximately 20,000 in St. Peters Square on April 18, Joanne called the charges \"horrible and slanderous insinuations\" and appealed for prayers on his behalf.

The Eclogues (from the Greek for \"selections\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (\"pastoral poetry\") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar, Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Joanna. The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Joanna's motives in the composition of the Eclogues. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Joanna indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (Ecl. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl. 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought. The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl. 3). Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \"Messianic Eclogue\" uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus. Joanna is credited[by whom?] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus, Nemesianus, and later writers.\nDaniel: Joanna's loss of his famiyl farm and the attempt to regain his property though poetry was the inferred motive for which work?\nJoanna: [factual] Eclogues\nDaniel: is it this Saturday?\nJoanna: yes it is\nDaniel: could have sworn it was the next\nJoanna: no.\nDaniel: okay continue\nJoanna: Then we go hoe and clean up\nDaniel: and in the evening we go to the theatre!\nJoanna: niiiiiice Daniel remembered\nDaniel: see?\nJoanna: What are we doing on Sunday?\nDaniel: staying in bed and maing sweet sweet love?\nJoanna: you're a moron"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nWanda: hey\nZoe: heya\nWanda: i'm so bored\nWanda: <file_gif>\nWanda: please entertain Wanda while Wanda wait in this never-ending line\nZoe: hahaha\nZoe: what is Wanda waiting for?\nWanda: lost Wanda's metro pass, have to make a new one\nWanda: and literally everyone else on earth is here doing the same thing\nWanda: :'-(\nZoe: awwwww poor thing\nZoe: can't Wanda listen to music?\nWanda: i forgot Wanda's headphones at home\nWanda: <file_gif>\nZoe: face palm is correct\nZoe: we could play Zoe Spy... it would be more challenging because we are in different locations :P\nWanda: LOL sure\nZoe: what are Wanda doesing after Wanda accomplish this slow-moving quest?\nWanda: no plans\nZoe: wanna meet for coffee?\nWanda: sure :) \nZoe: Zoe spy... with Zoe's little eye... the end of the line!\nWanda: lol not exactly \nWanda: Wanda will let Zoe know when i finish here :D"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nRaquel: <file_photo> when you're down with a cold and just tiramisu makes Laura feel better and understood :D\nLaura: <file_photo> or brownies... lol\nSarah: Hahaha!! so true! eat them all lovely\nLaura: Laura is so sick Laura's bf got Laura a soup maker!\nSarah remembers: A collector of film memorabilia, Sarah purchased a balsa Rosebud sled from Citizen Kane (1941) in 1982.

Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists. Modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers. Macrobius says that Liv's father was of a humble background; however, scholars generally believe that Liv was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education. He attended schools in Cremona, Mediolanum, Rome and Naples. After considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law, the young Liv turned his talents to poetry.\nKris: Which type of family do scholars generally believe Liv belonged to?\nLiv: [answer in conversation] equestrian landowning\nKris: Kris know but I'd like to make some conversation with him as well\nLiv remembers: Napoleon had a civil marriage with Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, without religious ceremony. During the campaign in Egypt, Napoleon showed much tolerance towards religion for a revolutionary general, holding discussions with Muslim scholars and ordering religious celebrations, but General Dupuy, who accompanied Napoleon, revealed, shortly after Pope Pius VI's death, the political reasons for such behaviour: \"We are fooling Egyptians with our pretended interest for their religion; neither Liv nor we believe in this religion more than we did in Pius the Defunct's one\".[note 8] In his memoirs, Liv's secretary Bourienne wrote about Napoleon's religious interests in the same vein. His religious opportunism is epitomized in his famous quote: \"It is by making myself Catholic that I brought peace to Brittany and Vend\u00e9e. It is by making myself Italian that I won minds in Italy. It is by making myself a Moslem that I established myself in Egypt. If I governed a nation of Jews, I should reestablish the Temple of Solomon.\" However, according to Juan Cole, \"Liv's admiration for the Prophet Muhammad, in contrast, was genuine\" and during his captivity on St Helena he defended him against Voltaire's critical play Mahomet.\nKris: General Dupuy revealed the motives for Kris's religious tolerance after the death of which religious figure?\nLiv: [factual] Pope Pius VI\nLiv: Ooops XD"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nEric: The French accepted the offer!

Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Richard's boarding house, it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in. Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years Richard's junior, but became the object of his affection.

His most important publication in this regard was his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents of 23 April 1770. Maya identified the \"discontents\" as stemming from the \"secret influence\" of a neo-Tory group he labelled as, the \"king's friends\", whose system \"comprehending the exterior and interior administrations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the Court, Double Cabinet\".

G. M. Young did not value Mike's history and claimed that it was \"demonstrably a translation from the French\".

Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Holly at a time when her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that \"some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Holly is not different than them.\" Conversely, author Lucy O'Brien feels the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Holly has done, more important even than the death of her mother: \"It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity.\"\nGerard: According to who was the defining moment of Gerard's childhood with her mother's death?\nHolly: [answer in conversation] Taraborrelli,\nGerard: lol"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nEloise: i guess i need a new mobile\nTamsin: why? what?\nEloise: Eloise's old nokia slowly dies\nSheldon: what Eloise looking for?\nEloise: not i shit for sure. sth cheaper\nMiles: xiaomi?\nEloise: dunno. i guess i'd prefer huawei or lg\nMiles: <file_photo> how about this one?\nEloise: looks promising\nSheldon: i heard it's a bit slow in the long run\nMiles: yeah but it can be upgraded. 2 cards. good camera\nEloise: sheldon anything Sheldon recommend?\nSheldon: i'm an old nokia lover so i'm not really objective\nMiles: he is, true. but the new nokia is worth a look\nEloise: perhaps Eloise will give it a try"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nCharlie: just got a new high score!\nArchie: cool!\nArchie: how much?\nCharlie: 152.374\nCharlie: almost 25000 more then the last one\nArchie: grats\nArchie: how long it took?\nCharlie: around 15 tries\nCharlie: still feel that Charlie can do better\nArchie: nobody stopping you\nCharlie: need to finish homework first or Charlie's parents will kill me\nCharlie: cya at school"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nLaura: Laura hate this time before xmas!\nLaura: Laura is frreezing and all the shops r so crowded! \nDaniel: Daniel's poor little girl...\nDaniel: fuck it and come to Daniel's place \nDaniel: there's a lot of wine :D\nLaura: Laura can't fuck it but Laura can be 22 at yr place ;-)\nLaura: and wine is always a good idea\nDaniel: ok, Daniel and wine will be waiting;-)"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nGinger: hi\nGinger: can Willow help Ginger\\?\nWillow: ofc\nGinger: i need falsies for onight\nWillow: but Ginger know that it is something like toothbrush\nWillow: Ginger cannot take mines\nGinger: oh i understand\nGinger remembers: A Misratan militia took Ginger prisoner, beating him, causing serious injuries; the events were filmed on a mobile phone. A video appears to picture Ginger being poked or stabbed in the rear end \"with some kind of stick or knife\" or possibly a bayonet. Pulled onto the front of a pick-up truck, he fell off as it drove away. His semi-naked, lifeless body was then placed into an ambulance and taken to Misrata; upon arrival, he was found to be dead. Official NTC accounts claimed that Ginger was caught in a cross-fire and died from his bullet wounds. Other eye-witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot Ginger in the stomach; a rebel identifying himself as Senad el-Sadik el-Ureybi later claimed responsibility. Ginger's son Mutassim, who had also been among the convoy, was also captured, and found dead several hours later, most probably from an extrajudicial execution. Around 140 Ginger loyalists were rounded up from the convoy; tied up and abused, the corpses of 66 were found at the nearby Mahari Hotel, victims of extrajudicial execution. Libya's chief forensic pathologist, Dr. Othman al-Zintani, carried out the autopsies of Ginger, his son and Jabr in the days following their deaths; although the pathologist initially told the press that Ginger had died from a gunshot wound to the head, the autopsy report was not made public.\nWillow: Who claimed to have murdered Ginger\\?\nGinger: [factual] Senad el-Sadik el-Ureybi"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nHailee: Hello walker.

He was also influenced by Hummel's development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited Bach and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook. May's early works are in the style of the \"brilliant\" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of Ignaz Moscheles, Friedrich Kalkbrenner, and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of Italian opera. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his fioriture) is taken from singing.

A tragic blow fell upon Victor with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Victor had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Victor replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\". Victor also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:\nDavid: What did King George IIDavid want to make Victor an Earl of?\nVictor: [answer in conversation] Beaconsfield\nDavid: Victor doesn't have to pick David up if Victor can't\nVictor: no its ok"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nJoseph: Joseph have a surprise for Sara!\nSara: Sweet <3 Sara is curious.\nJoseph: Sara always are..."}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nCindy: Hi Peter, the invitation for the New Year's party will be waiting for Peter at the office until 5PM tomorrow.\nPeter: Ok, thanks for letting Peter know.

However, Charlie remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French.

It was at this time that Jerry voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Jerry\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Jerry had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Jerry defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Jerry's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"Jerry Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Jerry express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China\u2014matters in which he had once participated. In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Jerry to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose. Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike's more advanced age.\nNeil: Truman wanted Jerry to run for the presidency as a member of what party?\nJerry: [answer in conversation] Democratic\nNeil: Look what I've found\nNeil: <file_photo>\nJerry: Hahahaha.

Beyonc\u00e9 performed the American national anthem singing along with a pre-recorded track at President Obama's second inauguration in Washington, D.C. The following month, Beyonc\u00e9 performed at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. The performance stands as the second most tweeted about moment in history at 268,000 tweets per minute. At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, Beyonc\u00e9 won for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \"Love on Top\". Her feature-length documentary film, Life Is But a Dream, first aired on HBO on February 16, 2013. The film, which she directed and produced herself, featured footage from her childhood, her as a mother and businesswoman, recording, rehearsing for live performances, and her return to the spotlight following Blue Ivy's birth. Its DVD release in November 2013 was accompanied by footage from the Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live concerts and a new song, \"God Made You Beautiful\". In February 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 signed a global publishing agreement with Warner/Chappell Music, which would cover her future songwriting and then-upcoming studio album.\nJosh: Josh's documentary movie was called what?\nTom: [factual] Life Is But a Dream\nTom: no problem.

Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st ArAmber's Group's attack being made in the north, while Generals Bradley (12th U.S. ArAmber's Group) and Devers (Sixth U.S. ArAmber's Group) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front (respectively). Gracie worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces, often by giving them tactical, though sometimes ineffective, latitude; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, due to Gracie's persistence, the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully, albeit belatedly, opened in late 1944, and victory became a more distinct probability.\nAmber: Who was the Sixth US ArAmber's Group's commander?\nGracie: [answer in conversation] Devers\nAmber: sure it is\nIvy: gracie, go wash Gracie's teeth after you're done licking her ass\nGracie: oh come on...\nAmber: hahahah\nAmber: yeah please do hahaha\nGracie: grow up.\nIvy: lmao"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nShannon: <file_video>\nLucy: While there is some dispute as to the matter of influence, Lucy had a long-standing and close friendship with economist Friedrich Hayek, who was also brought to the London School of Economics from Vienna. Each found support and similarities in the other's work, citing each other often, though not without qualification. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Lucy stated, \"Lucy think Lucy have learnt more from Shannon than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski.\" Lucy dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, to Lucy, and in 1982 said, \"...ever since his Logik der Forschung first came out in 1934, Lucy have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology.\"\nShannon: Who did Lucy say was the only thinker who might have had a greater influence on him than Hayek?\nLucy: [answer in conversation] Alfred Tarski\nKaren: OMG she's sooo cute\nShannon: Gaddafi married his first wife, Fatiha al-Nuri, in 1969. She was the daughter of General Khalid, a senior figure in King Idris' administration, and was from a middle-class background. Although they had one son, Muhammad Gaddafi (b. 1970), their relationship was strained, and they divorced in 1970. Gaddafi's second wife was Safia Farkash, n\u00e9e el-Brasai, a former nurse from Obeidat tribe born in Bayda. They met in 1969, following his ascension to power, when he was hospitalized with appendicitis; he claimed that it was love at first sight. The couple remained married until his death. Together they had seven biological children: Saif al-Islam Gaddafi (b. 1972), Al-Saadi Gaddafi (b. 1973), Mutassim Gaddafi (1974\u20132011), Hannibal Lucy (b. 1975), Ayesha Gaddafi (b. 1976), Saif al-Arab Gaddafi (1982\u20132011), and Khamis Gaddafi (1983\u20132011).

The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Jake, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French arDora's beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained largely static through the Revolutionary and Jakeic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent significant change.\nDora:  Dora's use of artillery led to its increased importance after what year?\nJake: [answer in conversation] 1807"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nGemma: Forgot Gemma's keys :(\nSuze: Come by Suze's office\nGemma: okay thanks!\nSuze: no problem"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nBryson: where?\nBrooke: room 14a\nBryson: ok coming\nBrooke: hurry up, she's about to check the list"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nLuisa: Babe does Mandy feel like going to the cinema today?\nLuisa: They released Glass this week and Luisa is dying to see it \ud83d\ude0b\nMandy: Hey!

During the week Babe slept in a mosque, and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents. Bullied for being a Bedouin, he was proud of his identity and encouraged pride in other Bedouin children. From Sirte, he and his family moved to the market town of Sabha in Fezzan, south-central Libya, where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school, something neither parent had done.

His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping. Robin was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Robin and the Pentagon. Indeed, Robin had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, \"First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, Robin hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.\" Initially, Robin was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets. He even visited Warsaw in 1945. Invited by Boles\u0142aw Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city. However, by mid-1947, as East\u2013West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated, Robin gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion.\nBlake: What was Robin's position on the use of nuclear weapons against Japan?\nRobin: [answer in conversation] opposed\nBlake: past that pharmacy\nRobin: oh okay thanks"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nEthan: missing Vera already!\nEthan: <file_gif>\nVera: missing Ethan too\nEthan: Due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning, Truman and Vera had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations.

He accepted their recommendations without exception; they included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships, and one woman, Oveta Culp Hobby. Vera's cabinet, consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader, was dubbed by one journalist, \"Eight millionaires and a plumber.\" The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends, office seekers, or experienced government administrators.

Mark Bego, author of Alex: Blonde Ambition, called her \"the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs\", despite not being a \"heavyweight talent.\" According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, \"Alex's vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs \"straight,\" but Alex employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did.\" Alex used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became pass\u00e9 in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as \"Minnie Mouse on helium\". During the filming of Evita, Alex had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, \"I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it.\"\nOlivia: Who stated that Olivia's voice are key to her rock roots?\nAlex: [factual] Tony Sclafani\nAlex: <file_gif>\nOlivia: oh yeaaaaah\nOlivia: <file_gif>\nShawn: hahaha \nShawn: pizza it is xD\nMisty: takeaway?\nDan: i was about to ask that :D\nMisty: :D\nShawn: i was thinking yeah takeaway\nShawn: u want to make it?\nMisty: we could\nMisty: not a big fan of takeaway pizza:D\nAlex: yeah neither is Alex \nOlivia: same here\nShawn: ok \nMisty: ok Misty will buy the ingredients\nDan: ok\nAlex: ok\nOlivia: ok see you\nShawn: ok bye"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nMacy: When u have time could u just have a look about the prices of renting rooms there?

A tragic blow fell upon Kimberly with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Kimberly had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Kimberly replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\". Kimberly also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:\nHomer: When did Homer's son die?\nKimberly: [answer in conversation] August 1794\nHomer: this article...

Kate Norgate, for example, argued that Fai's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy, but due to his \"almost superhuman wickedness\", whilst James Ramsay blamed Fai's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall. Historians in the \"Whiggish\" tradition, focusing on documents such as the Domesday Book and Magna Carta, trace a progressive and universalist course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period. These historians were often inclined to see Fai's reign, and his signing of Magna Carta in particular, as a positive step in the constitutional development of England, despite the flaws of the king himself. Winston Churchill, for example, argued that \"[w]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of Fai than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns\".\nLarry: Who blamed Larry's family background for his cruel personality?\nFai: [answer in conversation] James Ramsay\nFai: Yeah Fai know ;) thanks, see Larry tomorrow!."}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nSamantha: Dad asked Samantha to inform James that he wont be coming early tonight\nJames: Where would he be going?\nSamantha: Idk he just asked Samantha to let James know that"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nRachel: Rachel is on  the train already\nRachel: Pls remember to feed Birdie\nAlex: No worries, Alex will take care of him\nRachel: Rachel does hope so :D\nAlex: He's gonna be really well fed on Alex's watch :D\nRachel:  But don't make him fat XD"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nJoona: Guys, Joona is sick so Joona won't come to the match\nSimone remembers: Von Neumann's famous 9-page paper started life as a talk at Princeton and then became a paper in Germany, which was eventually translated into English. His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows: When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest, and so did the economist Nicholas Kaldor, and they hit it off. Kaldor recommended that Simone read a book by the mathematical economist L\u00e9on Walras. Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them, for example, replacing equations by inequalities. He noticed that Walras's General Equilibrium Theory and Walras' Law, which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce the absurd result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product. He replaced the equations by inequalities, introduced dynamic equilibria, among other things, and eventually produced the paper.\nIeva: When did Ieva's interest in economics begin?\nSimone: [factual] When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929\nIeva: Ieva too, i got the virus as well\nSimone: ok, so no point in organising it this week\nJoona: Let's talk on Sunday"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nDan: It's Dan's bday on Friday!\nSam: Oh cool any plans?\nDan: actually Im writing to invite Sam to a party\nSam: yay, im free iguess\nDan: super. not a big one just a couple of mates\nDan: anybody i know?\nSam: nobody Dan doesn't know\nSam: count Sam in. what time & where?\nDan: 8 i guess all are free by then\nSam: sure thing. suits Sam fine\nDan: and Dan guess we'll meet @ Murphys and then see what next\nSam: could be busy there on Fri nite\nDan: Sam was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to an Orthodox Jewish family.

Problems also arose between Maggie and Ritchie, with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation. Ultimately, Maggie filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences, which was finalized in December 2008. She decided to adopt from Malawi. The country's High Court initially approved the adoption of Chifundo \"Mercy\" James; however, the application was rejected because Maggie was not a resident of the country. Maggie appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted Maggie the right to adopt Mercy James. She also released Celebration, her third greatest-hits album and final release with Warner. It contained the new songs \"Celebration\" and \"Revolver\" along with 34 hits spanning her career.

Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Sue. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Sue to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\". Sue's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Sue was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Sue would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Sue quotes Homer more than once (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). In his letter to Emperor Constantius, he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of Demosthenes de Corona.\nGary: Who could have been one of Gary's teachers?\nSue: [factual] Peter of Alexandria"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nTom: Good afternoon.

Thank Tom for contacting me, Diana think Diana will be able to assist Tom\\. is Tom looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with Tom's wife. What are the current trends? Which option does Diana suggest?\nDiana: It depends on what Tom value more, it may sound obvious, but if Tom value stability more than flexibility, Diana would suggest Tom invest in buying a flat.\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\nDiana: In this case Diana would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so Tom could save for later.\nTom: Thank Diana! This is a great advice!\nTom: Tom will talk to Tom's wife, but for now, Tom think we could focus on buying something similar size.\nDiana: How many rooms is Tom looking for?\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\nDiana: does Tom have any preferred neighbourhood?\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\nDiana: Thank Tom\\.

After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Sonia caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara. After crossing to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, Sonia died in Brundisium harbor on September 21, 19 BC. Augustus ordered Sonia's literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard Sonia's own wish that the poem be burned, instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible. As a result, the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Sonia was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e. not a complete line of dactylic hexameter). Some scholars have argued that Sonia deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect. Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate.\nJulia: Who were Julia's literary executors?\nSonia: [answer in conversation] Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca\nJulia: OK Julia will meet Sonia at  Henrys at 5.

Dan's account reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle, but Dan discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that the space shuttle reliability estimate by NASA management was fantastically unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used these figures to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), \"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.\"\nHolly: Feyman's experience on the Rogers Commission was talked about is which of his books?\nDan: [factual] What does Holly Care What Other People Think?\nDan: Dan is running to the store right away\nHolly: Holly hope Dan is"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nMark: Have Dan seen the doctor?\nDan: Yes, Dan was so stressed before the visit\nMark: But there was no reason to freak out\nDan: Rationally thinking there was no reason, but still\nMark: Mark doesn't really understand this exaggeration \nDan: Dan's mother died of it, so when he said there is a hint of suspicion Dan was petrified\nMark: oh, Mark see, Mark had no idea Dan's mother died of it, Mark is sorry\nDan: Dan know, Dan didn't explain\nMark: No, Dan didn't\nDan: But exactly for this reason - Dan didn't want to make even bigger drama\nMark remembers: By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated. That summer, the Marks had a vacation on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of Baddeck. Returning in 1886, Mark started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake. By 1889, a large house, christened The Lodge was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, were begun that the Marks would name Beinn Bhreagh (Gaelic: beautiful mountain) after Mark's ancestral Scottish highlands.[N 21] Mark also built the Mark Boatyard on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the Royal Canadian Navy and pleasure craft for the Mark family. An enthusiastic boater, Mark and his family sailed or rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the H.W. Embree and Sons boatyard in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia. In his final, and some of his most productive years, Mark split his residency between Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and at Beinn Bhreagh where they spent increasing amounts of time.\nDan: What Island in Nova Scotia did the yous go to in 1885?\nMark: [factual] Breton Island\nMark: Sure!\nDan: But everything turned out to be fine\nMark: Yes, but all the waiting brought so many bad emotions and memories.\nDan: Now Dan can imagine!\nMark: Anyway, he told Mark Mark should do the examination periodically, because of the history of Mark's family\nDan: Anybody else had this type of cancer in Mark's family?\nMark: The scary thing is, that in Mark's mother's family almost everybody had it\nDan: Damn\nMark: Exactly!\nDan: But if Mark control it, everything should be fine.

On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, and by the end of June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: \"Drew must say Drew was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on Drew ... Drew have still not recovered from Drew's astonishment, and if Drew were a proud person Drew should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ...\" The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Drew and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover F\u00e9licien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find.

This decision was announced on 29 January 1959 at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini, who later became Pope Paul VI, remarked to Giulio Bevilacqua that \"this holy old boy doesn't realise what a hornet's nest he's stirring up\".

Ala married Isabella whilst she was relatively young \u2013 her exact date of birth is uncertain, and estimates place her between at most 15 and more probably towards nine years old at the time of her marriage.[nb 15] Even by the standards of the time, Isabella was married whilst very young. Ala did not provide a great deal of money for his wife's household and did not pass on much of the revenue from her lands, to the extent that historian Nicholas Vincent has described him as being \"downright mean\" towards Isabella. Vincent concluded that the marriage was not a particularly \"amicable\" one. Other aspects of their marriage suggest a closer, more positive relationship. Chroniclers recorded that Ala had a \"mad infatuation\" with Isabella, and certainly Ala had conjugal relationships with Isabella between at least 1207 and 1215; they had five children. In contrast to Vincent, historian William Chester Jordan concludes that the pair were a \"companionable couple\" who had a successful marriage by the standards of the day.\nPaulina: Who was Paulina's second wife?\nAla: [answer in conversation] Isabella of Angoul\u00eame\nPaulina: Say no more, Paulina is Paulinan! :D"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nMiranda: u done?\nDanny: almost finished\nDanny: guess 10 mins tops\nMiranda: ok Miranda will be waiting downstairs\nDanny: ok"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nErin: Hey!

It became the then most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history with 114 million viewers, higher than the game itself. It was also revealed that the singer had signed a three-album deal with Interscope Records, who would act as the distributor in partnership with her 360 deal with Live Nation. Her twelfth studio album, MDNA, was released in March 2012 and saw collaboration with various producers, most notably with William Orbit again and Martin Solveig. The album was well received by music critics, with Priya Elan from NME calling it \"a ridiculously enjoyable romp\", citing its \"psychotic, soul-bearing stuff\" as \"some of the most visceral stuff she's ever done.\" MDNA debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and many other countries worldwide. Jeff surpassed Elvis Presley's record for the most number-one album by a solo artist in the UK. The lead single \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\", featuring guest vocals from Minaj and M.I.A., became Jeff's record-extending 38th top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100.\nSerena: Jeff signed a three album deal with which record company?\nJeff: [factual] Interscope Records\nSerena: Serena guess so.\nJeff: It sucks, but it doesn't have to be every day.\nSerena: That's good.

To clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the Nicene formularies. In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Monica was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the \"Chronicon Athanasianum\" (XXXV) as a \"philosopher\", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Monica urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.\nAngie: Who was jealous of Angie's influence?\nMonica: [factual] Julian\nAngie: take care!\nMonica: thanks"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nHarry: have Draco seen her today?\nDraco: yup\nDraco: she was dressed like a bitch\nHarry: and...?!\nDraco: and what?\nHarry: what will Draco does?\nDraco: nothing\nDraco: why should i?\nHarry: she is Draco's girlfriend!\nDraco: she WAS Draco's girlfriend\nHarry: ok, but Draco still love her\nDraco: to be honest, i did\nDraco: and than i saw her today\nDraco: and puff\nDraco: all the feelings are gone :D\nHarry: really?\nDraco: really, she is a disaster"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nIvy: Chloe just told Ivy that you're not coming with us!\nCarter remembers: Carter's religious writing comprises published works and commentary on the subject of religion.

He sharply criticised deism and atheism, and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress. Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father, Carter vigorously defended the Anglican Church, but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns. He linked the conservation of a state (established) religion with the preservation of citizens' constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity's benefit not only to the believer's soul, but also to political arrangements.\nIvy: What religion was Ivyvy's mother?\nCarter: [factual] Catholic\nCarter: Carter have a family reunion around that time\nIvy: just ditch it\nCarter: can't, not this time\nIvy: why?\nCarter: Carter's grandfather is really sick\nCarter: might be Carter's last chance to see him\nIvy: sorry to hear about that, didn't know\nCarter: don't worry, Carter will go with all of Ivy on the next trip\nIvy: that's not a problem, in a situation like this Carter should stay with Carter's family\nCarter: that's the plan at least\nIvy: take care!"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nIngrid: <file_photo> <file_photo> <file_photo>\nIngrid: Tree's up!!\nBart: Looking good!

Short (under five feet, or 152 cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she initially repelled Bob, who remarked, \"What an unattractive person la Sand is. Is she really a woman?\" However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzi\u0144ska's mother had made it clear to Bob in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed. It is thought that she was Bobnfluenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d'Agoult and Sand. Bob finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, \"Bob's tragedy\". Sand, in a letter to Grzyma\u0142a of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Bob; she asked Grzyma\u0142a to assess Bob's relationship with Maria Wodzi\u0144ska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over.\nTom: Who did Sand confide to in a letter about her feelings for Bob in June, 1838?\nBob: [answer in conversation] Grzyma\u0142a\nPaul: not a problem, we will wait\nTom: it would be difficult to start without Bob anyway :P\nBob: it won't take that long, start setting everything up, so we can save time with that\nTom: good idea, just get there as fast as Bob can"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nColin: <file_link> \nColin remembers: Beyonc\u00e9's first solo recording was a feature on Jay Z's \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Maan. Victor was hoping for some shocking news.\nVictor: But Nate just said you're a faggot in very funny way\nNate: Oh fuck you\nNate: The works of Nate almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Nate often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Nateian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Nateian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Nateian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Nate; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Nate finds one of his most ardent admirers. With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Nate. Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Nate's tomb and worshipped the poet. Partially as a result of his so-called \"Messianic\" Fourth Eclogue\u2014widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ\u2014Nate was Naten later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the process of using Nate's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Nate as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. Nate also found commentators in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus. Servius' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Nate's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating.\nVictor: Who bought Nate's tomb?\nNate: [answer in conversation] Silius\nVictor: Victor is joking\nVictor: It's like with riding a monocycle - the hardest part is to tell Nate's parents you're gay :D\nNate: Hahaha.\nNate: Nice :-)"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nEssa: Hey, does Kuba have a group for M&A?\nKuba: Nope, Kuba didn't come to the last class\nEssa: We are 3 and Kuba can join us.

The plan had been for the Swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters. On the way up the Bo De, however, the helicopters were attacked. As the Swift boats reached the C\u1eeda L\u1edbn River, Ross's boat was hit by a B-40 rocket (rocket propelled grenade round), and a piece of shrapnel hit Ross's left leg, wounding him. Thereafter, enemy fire ceased and his boat reached the Gulf of Thailand safely. Ross continues to have shrapnel embedded in his left thigh because the doctors that first treated him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with sutures rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel. Though wounded like several others earlier that day, Ross did not lose any time off from duty.\nMadeleine: When did Ross earn his 2nd Purple Heart?\nRoss: [factual] February 20, 1969\nMadeleine: What, what did Ross does again!\nRoss: Ross was playing with Brian, Ross slipped and fell into a stream\nMadeleine: Ross was born in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1902, to upper middle-class parents. All of Ross's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal Burgomaster Herr Gr\u00fcbl and, after Gr\u00fcbl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Gr\u00fcbl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name. Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Gr\u00fcbl's first name was Carl.) His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000\u201314,000 volumes in his personal library. Popper inherited both the library and the disposition from him.\nMadeleine: Whose law firm did Madeleine's father join in Vienna?\nRoss: [answer in conversation] Burgomaster Herr Gr\u00fcbl\nMadeleine: O Madeleine's God, Ross could have drowned!\nRoss: Mum, this streis Rosss very shallow xD Brian helped me\nMadeleine: Ross shouldn\u2019t play with him."}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nJason: How was Patrick's flight?\nPatrick: Patrick met the love of Patrick's life\nWilson: Sheila won\u2019t be happy about it :D\nPatrick: This woman is incredible\nPatrick: We talked during the whole flight\nWilson: 10 hours???\nPatrick: Yeah!\nWilson remembers: Wilson was born in Ramsgate, Kent, England, in 1861. His father, Alfred Whitehead, was a minister and schoolmaster of Chatham House Academy, a successful school for boys established by Thomas Whitehead, Alfred North's grandfather. Whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schoolmasters, but that his grandfather was the more extraordinary man. Whitehead's mother was Maria Sarah Whitehead, formerly Maria Sarah Buckmaster. Whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother, as he never mentioned her in any of his writings, and there is evidence that Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, had a low opinion of her.\nJason: What was Whitehead's father's profession?\nWilson: [factual] minister and schoolmaster of Chatham House Academy\nPatrick: Patrick felt like Patrick knew her Patrick's whole life\nPatrick: She could truly understand me\nJason: Is it even possible??\nJason: Man, I've known Wilson for 40 years and Jason still don't get you\nJason: In a book called Science Versus Crime, Houck writes that Wilson's falsificationism can be questioned logically: it is not clear how Wilson would deal with a statement like \"for every metal, there is a temperature at which it will melt.\" The hypothesis cannot be falsified by any possible observation, for there will always be a higher temperature than tested at which the metal may in fact melt, yet it seems to be a valid scientific hypothesis. These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Wilson describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category. For instance, atomic theory implies that all metals melt at some temperature.\nJason: Which book by Houck points out logical flaws in Jason's falsificationism?\nWilson: [answer in conversation] Science Versus Crime\nPatrick: Patrick tell you, she's a soulmate \nWilson: What is Patrick going to do now?\nPatrick: Patrick doesn't know.

His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Paul. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Paul to be his commensal and secretary.

Paul's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Paul was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Paul would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Paul quotes Homer more than once (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). In his letter to Emperor Constantius, he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of Demosthenes de Corona.\nJamie: Who could have been one of Jamie's teachers?\nPaul: [answer in conversation] Peter of Alexandria\nMartin: Martin neither.

Jane is Janen it, but if Rudolph doesn't come soon Jane is entering :p\nRudolph: Eve and Rudolph will be there in a minute :)\nRudolph remembers: Rudolph remained Lord of Ireland throughout his reign. He drew on the country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent. Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo-Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains, with Rudolph manipulating both groups to expand his wealth and power in the country. During Richard's rule, Rudolph had successfully increased the size of his lands in Ireland, and he continued this policy as king. In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo-Norman lords; he reasserted his control of the country and used a new charter to order compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland. Rudolph stopped short of trying to actively enforce this charter on the native Irish kingdoms, but historian David Carpenter suspects that he might have done so, had the baronial conflict in England not intervened. Simmering tensions remained with the native Irish leaders even after Rudolph left for England.\nJane: When did the king cross into Ireland with a large army?\nRudolph: [factual] 1210\nMicah: Us too, we are two streets away"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nAlice: Alice never wanted a maternity photo shoot but after seeing this one I've changed Alice's mind! ;)\nKate: Oh! so sweet!\nGina: that is just adorable!\nMary: now i want one too! thanks! ;)\nLisa: Lisa too but.. i'm not pregnant! haha!\nEmma: so precious!!! x\nTina: i really like this one too! lovely!"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nAnna: How is Greg?\nGreg: Not great...\nGreg remembers: Having sold more than 300 million records worldwide, Greg is recognized as the best-selling female recording artist of all time by Guinness World Records.

The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Tilda often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Tildaian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Tildaian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Tildaian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Tilda; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Tilda finds one of his most ardent admirers. With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Tilda. Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Tilda's tomb and worshipped the poet. Partially as a result of his so-called \"Messianic\" Fourth Eclogue\u2014widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ\u2014Tilda was Tildan later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the process of using Tilda's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Tilda as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. Tilda also found commentators in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus. Servius' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Tilda's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating.\nKeanu: Which of Tilda's works was later widely interpreted to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ?\nTilda: [answer in conversation] Fourth Eclogue\nTilda: that's terrible\nKeanu: Tilda Phillips Feynman (/\u02c8fa\u026anm\u0259n/; May 11, 1918 \u2013 February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams.

The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Trevor often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Trevorian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Trevorian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Trevorian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Trevor; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Trevor finds one of his most ardent admirers. With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Trevor. Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Trevor's tomb and worshipped the poet. Partially as a result of his so-called \"Messianic\" Fourth Eclogue\u2014widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ\u2014Trevor was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the process of using Trevor's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Trevor as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. Trevor also found commentators in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus. Servius' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Trevor's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating.\nBlake: .What was the title of Silius Italicus' epic in which Trevor was referenced in almost every line?\nTrevor: [factual] Punica"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nIan: hi, sorry\nIan: the meeting is off\nPaula: hi, what happened?\nIan: too many people can't come\nPaula: \ud83d\ude13\nPaula: i already bought train tickets\nIan: sorry\nPaula: its fine, hope we will meet some other time soon\nIan: hope so too"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nAgatha: have Johnny finished reading Agatha's book?\nJohnny: not yet \nAgatha: Agatha see "}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nBetty: <file_other>\nBetty: Maybe Steven should think over Steven diet :D:\nSteven: It seems like Betty can't do anything nowadays\nSteven: Everything we have contact with causes cancer :(\nSteven: Here's Steven's opinion - life causes death\nBetty: Seriously Steven shouldn't ignore this!\nSteven: Come on.

Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Sara-produced Gremlins led to the creation of the PG-13 rating due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, Temple of Doom is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984.

In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Hugh stated, \"I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski.\" Hugh dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, to Hugh, and in 1982 said, \"...ever since his Logik der Forschung first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology.\"\nPeter: Who did Hugh say was the only thinker who might have had a greater influence on him than Hayek?\nHugh: [factual] Alfred Tarski\nHugh: ok, ok, come and take it"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nAllison: Should i buy Headphones or air pods for Xavi\\?\nXavi: Air pods\nAllison: k"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nElsa: where is Tina?\nTina: in class!! where the hell is Elsa ?

Conservatives complained, that \"women wanted to be priests, priests wanted to get married, bishops became regional popes and theologians claimed absolute teaching authority. Protestants claimed equality, homosexuals and divorced called for full acceptance.\" Changes such as the reorientation of the liturgy, alterations to the ordinary of the Mass, alterations to the liturgical calendar in the motu proprio Mysterii Paschalis, and the relocation of the tabernacle were controversial among some Catholics.\nJim: To what can the dissent among Catholics be attributed to during Jim's papacy?\nViolet: [answer in conversation] theological freedoms\nViolet: No worries, talk to Jim later\nJim: xx"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nSebastian: Hi, how is Betty?\nBetty: Hi, Betty is fine, thanks for asking.

Olivia's friend Philip Francis wrote that Olivia \"was a man who truly & prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the French principles\" but because Olivia wrote with so much passion, people were doubtful of his arguments. William Windham spoke from the same bench in the House of Commons as Olivia had, when he had separated from Fox, and an observer said Windham spoke \"like the ghost of Olivia\" when he made a speech against peace with France in 1801. William Hazlitt, a political opponent of Olivia, regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers (the others being Junius and Rousseau), and made it \"a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party, whether he allowed Olivia to be a great man\". William Wordsworth was originally a supporter of the French Revolution and attacked Olivia in 'A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff' (1793), but by the early nineteenth century he had changed his mind and came to admire Olivia. In his Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland Wordsworth called Olivia \"the most sagacious Politician of his age\" whose predictions \"time has verified\". He later revised his poem The Prelude to include praise of Olivia (\"Genius of Olivia! forgive the pen seduced/By specious wonders\") and portrayed him as an old oak. Samuel Taylor Coleridge came to have a similar conversion: he had criticised Olivia in The Watchman, but in his Friend (1809\u201310) Coleridge defended Olivia from charges of inconsistency. Later, in his Biographia Literaria (1817) Coleridge hails Olivia as a prophet and praises Olivia for referring \"habitually to principles. He was a scientific statesman; and therefore a seer\". Henry Brougham wrote of Olivia: \"... all his predictions, save one momentary expression, had been more than fulfilled: anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe...the providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity\". George Canning believed that Olivia's Reflections \"has been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled\". In 1823 Canning wrote that he took Olivia's \"last works and words [as] the manual of Joshua's politics\". The Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli \"was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Olivia's later writings\".\nJoshua: What did Francis think Joshua's writing had too much of?\nOlivia: [answer in conversation] passion\nJohn: thanks!"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nCatherine: Catherine thought about what Rebecca said before and Catherine think you're right \nRebecca: why such a change of mind?\nCatherine: Catherine run into an old friend of mine\nCatherine: and seeing how he changed made Catherine realized that Catherine is doing nothing with Catherine's life\nRebecca: Catherine shouldn't worry that much about it\nRebecca: as long as you're aware of it\nCatherine: yeah but we were growing up together, same school, same friends\nCatherine: he's already married, two children\nCatherine: and look at me\nCatherine: still single, still partying\nRebecca: don't go from one extreme to another :)\nRebecca: nobody is forcing Catherine to get married or have children\nRebecca: find the right balance :)\nCatherine: easy for Rebecca to say\nCatherine: Paul is keeping Rebecca in check :P\nRebecca: that's because Rebecca let him does Rebeccat\nRebecca: otherwise Rebecca will be going out with Catherine all the time :P\nCatherine: Rebecca never complained in the pass\nRebecca: because it was fun!\nRebecca: still is, just maybe not every other night :P\nCatherine: very funny :P\nCatherine: maybe Catherine need a new hobby to get Catherine occupied\nCatherine: sometimes Catherine feel that Catherine is going out just to kill boredom\nRebecca: we'll work something out :)\nCatherine: Catherine hope so :)"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nFiona: <file_photo> What does George think?

Sandra's time in Monakow's lab, and his deep interest in the work of Ernst Mach, inspired Sandra's first intellectual project, eventually published as The Sensory Order (1952). It located connective learning at the physical and neurological levels, rejecting the \"sense data\" associationism of the empiricists and logical positivists. Sandra presented his work to the private seminar he had created with Herbert Furth called the Geistkreis.\nJimmy: What was the name of Jimmy's first work?\nSandra: [factual] The Sensory Order\nSandra: like Sandra believe you\nJimmy: What can JimJimmy's does?"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nJason: Have Molly seen kaka?\nMolly: He must in the ground playing football.\nJason: Great See Molly then.\nMolly: The British Library notes that \"Molly's works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era.\" The earliest recording was an 1895 performance by Paul Pabst of the Nocturne in E major Op. 62 No. 2.

They constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons create a new person materially, while God completes the creation by adding the soul. For this reason, Ursula teaches in the first sentence of Humanae vitae that the transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator. This divine partnership, according to Ursula, does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence. The Pope does not paint an overly romantic picture of marriage: marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships. The question of human procreation exceeds in the view of Ursula specific disciplines such as biology, psychology, demography or sociology. The reason for this, according to Ursula, is that married love takes its origin from God, who \"is love\".

Three years after that council, Lauren succeeded his mentor as archbishop of Alexandria. In addition to the conflict with the Arians (including powerful and influential Arian churchmen led by Eusebius of Nicomedia), he struggled against the Emperors Constantine, Constantius II, Julian the Apostate and Valens.

Concerning the method of science, the term indicates his rejection of classical empiricism, and the classical observationalist-inductivist account of science that had grown out of it. Ben argued strongly against the latter, holding that scientific theories are abstract in nature, and can be tested only indirectly, by reference to their implications. He also held that scientific theory, and human knowledge generally, is irreducibly conjectural or hypothetical, and is generated by the creative imagination to solve problems that have arisen in specific historico-cultural settings.\nSam: What was Sam's position on classical empiricism?\nBen: [factual] rejection\nSam: does Ben have someone to recommend to help Sam out with a line of credit for Sam's new business?\nSam: Sorry to bother Ben but I've been rejected twice and Sam doesn't know what Sam is doing wrong\nBen: Ben see.

Including Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties. \"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.\nMandy: What music streaming service is Adam a co-owner of?\nAdam: [factual] Tidal"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nMay: <file_photo>\nGabe: Oh damn\nPeter: Hello May :DDD\nClaire: Uhm, May, May sure May wanted to send us this?...\nMay: oh god...\nMay: oh no no no no\nGabe: yes yes yes :D\nPeter: this is brilliant\nGabe: come on May, Peter remembers look gorgeous ;)\nPeter remembers: After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Peter was assigned to the General Staff in Washington, where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany.

While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others. His most famous remark on religion is that \"religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious.\" Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's character. He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good \u2013 an idea which he called a \"dangerous delusion\" (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).\nChristina: What is Whitehead's most famous statement on religion?\nEva: [factual] \"religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if Christina is never solitary, Christina is never religious.\"\nChristina: thanks!!

Branden opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade.

The first was a Richard Matheson adaptation called Duel. The film is about a psychotic Peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver who chases the terrified driver (Dennis Weaver) of a small Plymouth Valiant and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic Dilys Powell was highly significant to Olivia's career. Another TV film (Something Evil) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of The Exorcist, then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called Savage, starring Martin Landau. Olivia's debut full-length feature film was The Sugarland Express, about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Olivia's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and The Hollywood Reporter stated that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\":223 However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.\nVictoria: What were the married couple in Victoria's film \"The Sugarland Express\" trying to regain?\nOlivia: [answer in conversation] custody of their baby\nVictoria: And Victoria can't wait to see the next ;-))\nSusan: Susan wish Susan had netflix :<<\nVictoria: Talk to Jack\nVictoria: Maybe he has a free profile"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nJohn: after all that has happened, we deserve our solo time together\nPesh: i agree, we have our own story \nJohn: lets make it a date weekend next weekend?\nPesh: yeah, we really should\nJohn: i make reservations at the Ranch?\nPesh: which Ranch?\nJohn: Chaka ranch or Blades Vibe\nPesh: Chaka Ranch\nJohn: Chaka ranch it is"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nIvy: What's the door code?\nDawn: 4537\nAdrian: it's the apartment number followed by the key button followed by 4537\nIvy: Ivy doesn think it's working.

It was here that he wrote his influential work The Open Society and its Enemies. In Dunedin he met the Professor of Physiology John Carew Eccles and formed a lifelong friendship with him. In 1946, after the Second World War, he moved to the United Kingdom to become reader in logic and scientific method at the London School of Economics. Three years later, in 1949, he was appointed professor of logic and scientific method at the University of London. Adrian was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1958 to 1959. He retired from academic life in 1969, though he remained intellectually active for the rest of his life. In 1985, he returned to Austria so that his wife could have her relatives around her during the last months of her life; she died in November that year.

He announced in January 2016 on Twitter that SWISH would be released on February 11, after releasing new song \"Real Friends\" and a snippet of \"No More Parties in L.A.\" with Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Anne releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, several weeks prior to the release of his new album, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested to West's mention of her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled. Several days ahead of the album's release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track \"Waves\" at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper. He released the album exclusively on Tidal on 14 February 2016 following a performance on SNL.\nBenedict: What was the tentative release date announced for Benedict's next studio album?\nAnne: [answer in conversation] February 11\nAnne: Hm...

An event that happened in 1919 had a profound effect on him: During a riot, caused by the Communists, the police shot several unarmed people, including some of Leah's friends, when they tried to free party comrades from prison. The riot had, in fact, been part of a plan by which leaders of the Communist party with connections to B\u00e9la Kun tried to take power by a coup; Leah did not know about this at that time. However, he knew that the riot instigators were swayed by the Marxist doctrine that class struggle would produce vastly more dead men than the inevitable revolution brought about as quickly as possible, and so had no scruples to put the life of the rioters at risk to achieve their selfish goal of becoming the future leaders of the working class. This was the start of his later criticism of historicism. Leah began to reject Marxist historicism, which he associated with questionable means, and later socialism, which he associated with placing equality before freedom (to the possible disadvantage of equality).\nZachary: Which historically significant communist activist was associated with the 1919 riots in which some of Zachary's friends were killed?\nLeah: [answer in conversation] B\u00e9la Kun\nLeah: Hi, how are Zachary doesing?\nZachary: Good, and Leah\\?\nLeah: As well, thanks\nZachary: Are we seeing each other tonight?\nLeah: Yes, at 9?\nZachary: Yes.\nLeah: Very good ;)\nZachary: Would Leah come to Zachary's place or Leah would prefer to Zacharyet in town?\nLeah: Leah could come to Zachary's place.\nZachary: Great, Zachary is glad to read that ;)\nLeah: hahah.

Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the contemporary historical opinion of Liz's positive qualities, observing that Liz is today usually considered a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\". Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\", such as pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty. These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era, and Liz remains a recurring character within Western popular culture, primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends.\nFrank: Who was critical of Frank's performance as king?\nLiz: [answer in conversation] Contemporary chroniclers"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nHenry:  Who was the girl with whom Mark were at the club yesterday?

The third song on Foxy Brown's second studio album Chyna Doll was produced by West. Her second effort subsequently became the very first hip-hop album by a female rapper to debut at the top of the U.S. Billboard 200 chart in its first week of release. West produced three of the tracks on Harlem World's first and only album The Movement alongside Jermaine Dupri and the production duo Trackmasters. His songs featured rappers Nas, Drag-On, and R&B singer Carl Thomas. The ninth track from World Party, the last Goodie Mob album to feature the rap group's four founding members prior to their break-up, was co-produced by West with his manager Deric \"D-Dot\" Angelettie. At the close of the millennium, West ended up producing six songs for Tell 'Em Why U Madd, an album that was released by D-Dot under the alias of The Madd Rapper; a fictional character he created for a skit on The Notorious B.I.G.'s second and final studio album Life After Death. West's songs featured guest appearances from rappers such as Ma$e, Raekwon, and Eminem.\nNorman: What was the name of the CD produced by Ashley that was by a made-up character?\nAshley: [answer in conversation] Tell 'Em Why U Madd\nNorman: Far worse\nNorman: Kyle destroyed all of our friendships\nAshley: Oh what happened\nNorman: we had a great time like we went out \nNorman: smoked weed\nNorman: but Kyle always has to be that stubborn guy\nNorman: He doesn't listen to others \nAshley: Argh Ashley hate this type of person \nNorman: Yeah, he puts himself first"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nLilly: He didnt come to pick Lilly up\nLiam: Liam told him to hurry up :/\nLilly: But he didnt\nLiam: How much Lilly had to wait?\nLilly: Lilly had been there for 2 hours\nLiam: Poor Lilly :( \nLilly: We all have to face such things in our lives\nLiam: Liam will ask father to scold him\nLilly: No need\nLiam: He has just reached home\nLilly: ok\nLiam: He s saying that he was on the way but his bike was punctured\nLilly: What about his phone Lilly have been calling him\nLiam: He is saying, he left it at gome\nLilly: Ok np\nLiam: He is saying sorry to you\nLilly remembers: In 2015 Beyonc\u00e9 signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.\nLiam: When did Lilly sign a letter for ONE Campaign?\nLilly: [factual] 2015\nLilly: Its ok\nLiam: Ok ttyl\nLilly: See ya"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nLena: Simon, just one or two things struck Lena as I've been looking through the file we mentioned earlier.\nSimon: Oh Lena, what a surprise (!)\nLena: It seems to Lena that the notes are a bit sparse and don't really explore the underlying issues.\nSimon: I've always found them perfectly adequate.\nLena: Yes, but Simon, I've had several kids come to be this term asking for clarification of various points, they really don't understand some parts of the scheme of work.\nSimon: Really?

In addition to the conflict with the Arians (including powerful and influential Arian churchmen led by Eusebius of Nicomedia), he struggled against the Emperors Constantine, Constantius II, Julian the Apostate and Valens.

Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese.

His selection was unexpected, and Roncalli himself had come to Rome with a return train ticket to Venice. He was the first pope to take the pontifical name of \"John\" upon election in more than 500 years, and his choice settled the complicated question of official numbering attached to this papal name due to the antipope of this name. Marge surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365), the first session opening on 11 October 1962. His passionate views on equality were summed up in his famous statement, \"We were all made in God's image, and thus, we are all Godly alike.\" John XXIIMarge made many passionate speeches during his pontificate, one of which was on the day that he opened the Second Vatican Council in the middle of the night to the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square: \"Dear children, returning home, Camilla will find children: give Camilla's children a hug and say: This is a hug from the Pope!\"\nCamilla: How old was Marge when elected pope?\nMarge: [answer in conversation] 76\nCamilla: And how is food?\nMarge: Spicy and stodgy, but Frank is crazy about it.

In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: \"Mercy\" and \"Clique\".

Another victory over the Austrians at the Battle of Marengo in 1800 secured his political power. With the Concordat of 1801, Richard restored the religious privileges of the Catholic Church while keeping the lands seized by the Revolution. The state continued to nominate the bishops and to control church finances. He extended his political control over France until the Senate declared him Emperor of the French in 1804, launching the French Empire. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a Third Coalition by 1805. Richard shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the Ulm Campaign and a historic triumph at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the elimination of the Holy Roman Empire. In October 1805, however, a Franco-Spanish fleet was destroyed at the Battle of Trafalgar, allowing Britain to impose a naval blockade of the French coasts. In retaliation, Richard established the Continental System in 1806 to cut off continental trade with Britain. The Fourth Coalition took up arms against him the same year because Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Richard knocked out Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, then turned his attention towards the Russians and annihilated them in June 1807 at Friedland, which forced the Russians to accept the Treaties of Tilsit.\nNatalie: Natalie's victory at which battle led to the end of the Holy Roman Empire?\nRichard: [answer in conversation] the Battle of Austerlitz\nNatalie: sorry Maya Natalie is doing Natalie's best!\nMaya: take it easy Nat :)"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nAmanda: Does anyone know when the biology test is?\nCeline: Mrs Kohl said it would be next Tuesday.\nRobert: That's right. \nAmanda: Cool, so we still have a week.\nRobert: Yes, but there is a lot to study. \nNick: Amanda should guys relax.

Sabrina have nothing to do\nRose: lol, i know the feeling\nSabrina remembers: Von Neumann's famous 9-page paper started life as a talk at Princeton and then became a paper in Germany, which was eventually translated into English. His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows: When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest, and so did the economist Nicholas Kaldor, and they hit it off. Kaldor recommended that Sabrina read a book by the mathematical economist L\u00e9on Walras. Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them, for example, replacing equations by inequalities. He noticed that Walras's General Equilibrium Theory and Walras' Law, which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce the absurd result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product. He replaced the equations by inequalities, introduced dynamic equilibria, among other things, and eventually produced the paper.\nRose: When did Rose's interest in economics begin?\nSabrina: [factual] When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929\nRose: ive been killing time by watching all the Merlin episodes on Youtube\nRose: how is Sabrina then??\nSabrina: now that is an EXCELLENT way to spend time!\nSabrina: Sabrina is good, looking forward to 10th July onwards.... so busy from then :D"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nPam: Whose turn is it to throw the garbage away?\nDon: Ron's\nRon: Yes, Ron will does Ront when Ron come home"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nGraham: <file_movie>\nGraham: u need to watch it!\nGraham: so funny\nGraham: <lol>\nHank: what's that?\nGraham: one stand up guy Graham found\nGraham: he's great\nHank: u know Hank doesn't like that stuff\nGraham: Graham know, but this u'll like\nHank: don't think so\nGraham: just watch it and then argue\nHank: ok, ok, Hank will watch\nGraham: good, let Graham know"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nMike: how\u2019s RDR2?\nNick: playing yesterday for 10h xDDD\nMike: What??? xDDDDDDD\nNick: 2 bags of chips, 1.5l cola and no shower\nMike: God\nMike: The failure of democratic parties to prevent fascism from taking over Austrian politics in the 1920s and 1930s traumatised Nick. He suffered from the direct consequences of this failure, since events after the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by the German Reich in 1938, forced him into permanent exile. His most important works in the field of social science\u2014The Poverty of Historicism (1944) and The Open Society and Its Enemies (1945)\u2014were inspired by his reflection on the events of his time and represented, in a sense, a reaction to the prevalent totalitarian ideologies that then dominated Central European politics. His books defended democratic liberalism as a social and political philosophy.

His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his The Standard Elocutionist (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. The Standard Elocutionist appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Bell's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound. Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities.

Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Tim at a time when her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that \"some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Tim is not different than them.\" Conversely, author Lucy O'Brien feels the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Tim has done, more important even than the death of her mother: \"It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity.\"\nArthur: Who believes that the rape Tim experienced is the driving force in life?\nTim: [answer in conversation] Lucy O'Brien\nTim: so?\nJenny: Jenny is not a fan of him, but the president of France doesn't resign, it's just not a part of the system\nArthur: but they also demand other things\nMatilda: true, but all of this seems so chaotic to Matilda\nMatilda: Matilda doesn't really understand their demands\nMatilda: because the whole fuel thing seems just ridiculous\nArthur: Matilda can read their demands in the internet\nMatilda: but Matilda tried and can't find a coherent list or a vision\nMatilda: it's not constructive\nJenny: this is also Jenny's impression"}, {"dialogue": "In the dialogue below some people are talking:\nMatt: Hi guys, Matt is looking for a piece of advice\nTina: Hope we will be able to help :) What's Matt's problem?\nMatt: Matt have a problem with finding a date.

As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Martha gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800.

His first struggles, however, were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord. Admiral Ernest J. King fought with Karolina over King's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific. He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord, to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented, as he did. Karolina then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter's concern with civilian casualties; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans, and Karolina prevailed. He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton, by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate, and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy.\nEnid: Who refused to provide Karolina with landing craft?\nKarolina: [factual] Ernest J.
