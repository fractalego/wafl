Let\u2019s just meet at 7:15 in case there are many people in the line or you happen to prefer to eat the empanadas while standing rather than walking \ud83d\ude39\nAustin: Lol sounds perfect\nPaola: I\u2019ll see you at the theatre then.

Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\nDiana: Thank you. What's your current budget?\nTom: We were thinking about \u00a3400 000. Would it be possible?\nDiana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated?\nTom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for.\nDiana: How much are you aiming for?\nTom: At least \u00a3300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.\nDiana: Could you please send me some pictures?

But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.\nTarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. \nQuentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.\nQuentin: What were Library members known as?\nTarquin: I have no information about this\nTarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?\nQuentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.\nTarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?\nQuentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.\nTarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.\nQuentin: Yes, that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.\nTarquin: Yes. That's from Peter's company right?\nQuentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special \"Quentin price\" only on the evening of the unboxing.

I was thinking about Angelo's as well, but it happens that my cousin is Italian so I think it may be a bit risky to impress him with an Italian restaurant ;)\nCarl: Fair point. What about Toff's? They are famous for having the best fish and chips in the UK.\nAnne: Haven't heard about them! Where are they?\nCarl: Third zone, near Highgate. The area is beautiful, really worth going, especially if someone's never been to London.\nSarah: If you're looking for something more central, I highly recommend Yori.

It's not that we are really on a budget here, but wouldn't mind saving some for more touristic stuff ;)\nSarah: Cool, I find Yori affordable and their prive-value is really high in my opinion.\nCarl: Same for the Toff's, they mainly sell fish and fish and chips, so maybe check with your cousin if he likes it first.\nAnna: Oh, I bet he'd love to have an Instagram worthy photo with a fish and chips in London, hahaha!\nTom: If I were you, I'd focus on the bars more ;) Take him to Soho, skip the fancy ones though.\nAnna: That goes without a question!

If not, take the salted caramel for my sake.\nAnna: Always! I always go for the red velvet, even if Tom thinks it's overrated.\nTom: Because it is, it's just a normal cake with red dye in it.\nSarah: So Tom is definitely not going to Hummingbird with us :D Party pooper :P\nCarl: How long is your cousin staying?\nAnna: Four days so that's four lunches/dinners - waiting for your recommendations!\nTom: Hm... I would also suggest street food on Brick Lane or Borough's Market - if a party pooper may have something to say :P\nSarah: But never on a weekend!
